# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Every bug below must be fixed at its root cause. "Detect the
symptom and suppress the diagnostic" is not an acceptable fix.
If the type resolution pipeline produces wrong data, fix the
pipeline so it produces correct data. Downstream consumers
(diagnostics, hover, completion, definition) should never need
to second-guess upstream output.


## B16. PDOStatement fetch mode-dependent return types

**Blocked on:** [phpstorm-stubs#1882](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs/pull/1882)

`PDOStatement::fetch()` and `PDOStatement::fetchAll()` return
different types depending on the fetch mode constant passed as
the first argument. Once the upstream PR is merged and we update
our stubs, the existing conditional return type support should
handle this automatically.

**Tests:** Assertion lines were removed from
`tests/psalm_assertions/method_call.php` (out of scope until
upstream stubs land).
